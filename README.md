# QScreenCatcher

### Introduction

A simple screen capturing software that can capture the screen and export as PDF via shortcuts.
I developed QScreenCatcher to provide an efficient and silent screenshotting solution.
I wanted to create a tool that is straightforward to use, with a focus on seamless capturing and saving.
The app is powered by Python and PyQt, enabling cross-platform development.

### Some key features QScreenCatcher has implemented:

- Configurable hotkey ("V" default) to screenshot active windows
- Temporary screenshot storage during captures
- Export pictures to PDF after stopping capture
- Auto-copy PDFs to clipboard
- Customizable settings (hotkeys, save locations, etc.)

With QScreenCatcher, you can quickly document your work, meetings, tutorials, or anything currently shown on your
screen.

### Instructions
